- [ ] ABC
- [ ] Arduino (partially recognized, can be detected by Linguist, but cannot be searched, inside a repository with Arduino source code, it will be labeled as `other` but outside of a repository, it can be found in the language dropdown, and repository titlecard.

- [ ] Octave
- [ ] OpenCL (recognizes as C)
- [ ] Orwell
- [ ] Perl6 (partially recognized, can be detected by Linguist, but cannot be searched, inside a repository with Perl6 source code, it will be labeled as `other` but outside of a repository, it can be found in the language dropdown, and repository titlecard. However, attempting to sort by the Perl6 language will just perform an `all repositories` search) (side note: Perl6 was renamed to Raku, but Perl6 still is recognized as a separate language by the GitHub linguist), additionally, when in use on newer repositories, it recognizes as Raku, and does not have the old Perl 6 label. I don't know why this happens. Also, I added pod6 on the same day, I thought it wouldn't recognize, but it is fine
