# Unrecognized languages in use

The following languages have SNU Programming Tools Web-IDE and seanpm2001/Learn projects, but are not officially recognized by GitHubs linguist, as of 2022, Thursday, November 24th at 10:39 pm PST.

- [ ] ABC
- [ ] Arduino (partially recognized, can be detected by Linguist, but cannot be searched, inside a repository with Arduino source code, it will be labeled as `other` but outside of a repository, it can be found in the language dropdown, and repository titlecard. However, attempting to sort by the Arduino language will just perform an `all repositories` search)
- [ ] Amulet
- [ ] ALGOL
- [ ] ALS
- [ ] AssemblyScript
- [ ] B
- [ ] Blockly (basically just a JSON zip archive)
- [ ] CAML
- [ ] CH
- [ ] Cobra
- [ ] CSHTML (recognizes as HTML)
- [ ] Cyclone
- [ ] DCPU16-ASM (partially recognized, can be detected by Linguist, but cannot be searched, inside a repository with DCPU-16 ASM source code, it willl be labeled as `other` but outside of a repository, it can be found in the language dropdown, and repository titlecard. However, attempting to sort by the DCPU-16 ASM language will just perform an `all repositories` search)
- [ ] DroppedText (seanpm2001)
- [ ] Epigram
- [ ] FCL
- [ ] Fish (recognizes as Shell)
- [ ] FP
- [ ] Go! (the one Google blatantly steamrolled over, and mostly everyone kind of forgot)
- [ ] Hope
- [ ] Intel Hex (Binary)
- [ ] INTERCAL
- [ ] ISWIM
- [ ] Jade
- [ ] JavaScript++
- [ ] JFlex (recognizes as its own separate language, but shows up as Lex)
- [ ] Joy
- [ ] JScript (too similar to JavaScript)
- [ ] JScript.NET (also too similar to JavaScript)
- [ ] JSSS
- [ ] JSON5
- [ ] Jython
- [ ] KiXTart
- [ ] KRC (Kent Recursive Calculator)
- [ ] LiveCode (recently switched to being proprietary, older versions are still open source)
- [ ] Logcat
- [ ] Lingo
- [ ] Lucid
- [ ] NetREXX
- [ ] M4Sugar (commonly seen in the inner-linguist, but cannot get it to show as anything other than M4 on the outer Linguist)
- [ ] Mallard
- [ ] Matrix (seanpm2001)
- [ ] Maxima
- [ ] Miranda
- [ ] ML
- [ ] MS-DOS Style
- [ ] Oberon
- [ ] Octave
- [ ] OpenCL (recognizes as C)
- [ ] Orwell
- [ ] Perl6 (partially recognized, can be detected by Linguist, but cannot be searched, inside a repository with Perl6 source code, it will be labeled as `other` but outside of a repository, it can be found in the language dropdown, and repository titlecard. However, attempting to sort by the Perl6 language will just perform an `all repositories` search) (side note: Perl6 was renamed to Raku, but Perl6 still is recognized as a separate language by the GitHub linguist), additionally, when in use on newer repositories, it recognizes as Raku, and does not have the old Perl 6 label. I don't know why this happens. Also, I added pod6 on the same day, I thought it wouldn't recognize, but it is fine
- [ ] PostCSS (recognizes as CSS)
- [ ] PowerFX (basically just a YAML format)
- [ ] QueryByExample
- [ ] Refal
- [ ] SASL
- [ ] SASS
- [ ] Squeak! (basically just a JSON zip archive)
- [ ] Scratch 1.x (basically just a JSON zip archive)
- [ ] Scratch 2 (basically just a JSON zip archive)
- [ ] Scratch 3 (basically just a JSON zip archive)
- [ ] Seed7
- [ ] Starlark
- [ ] Sublime Text (justification for adding to Linguist: it is clearly a JSON language. Many more obscure XML and JSON languages are listed, why can't this one be?)
- [ ] SXML
- [ ] TSX (recognizes as TypeScript)
- [ ] URLL (seanpm2001)
- [ ] VBHTML (recognizes as Visual Basic .NET)
- [ ] Verona
- [ ] VisualLogic
- [ ] Wierd
- [ ] X-PixMap (recognizes as C)

**Total:** `73`

## Notes

For repositories based on unrecognized languages, I try to make HTML the dominant language in the Linguist.
