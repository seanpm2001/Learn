It is unofficially called `the Cairo phase` (since the first language worked with in the phase is the Cairo programming language) and will last until I reach 600 total languages. Previously, there was no structure for what qualified phase 5 to end or start, so a goal was needed. This change was long overdue.** _(worked with Cairo language)_ |

| #️⃣️006 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Wednesday, July 12th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, project language files for Whitespace were written, taking over an hour.

### [Overview](#Overview)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)]</u></b></p></summary>

This repository came out of maintenance mode for a twenty-fifth day in this major set. I kept the core Learn repository up to date in the history section only today, with little time to spare. I worked with the Smithy language today. I was not able to do project language file work today either. There will be a 2 day (weekend) hiatus now. Work will resume on Monday with the Hestia programming language. No new languages were discovered today, as of 11:53 pm PST. Documentation changes are getting a makeover, but have made this file harder to maintain. It is still a major work in progress. For now, it has mostly stalled. <!-- TODO: This line should be updated daily !-->

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

> **Note** _Future plan: Split up dialects and implementations into different sections._

1. [:octocat: `International Scheme`](https://github.com/metaphorm/international-scheme/) (discovered on 2023, June 2nd) currently figuring out if this software library can count as a separate language
2. `Turtle` (discovered on 2023, June 5th) turtle may just be a syntax, and not a standalone language, but I will need to look further into this before I can confirm.
3. `RDF Query Language` (discovered on 2023, June 6th) trying to figure out if this is a distinct language.
4. `MetaFont` (discovered on 2023, July 6th) I am trying to figure out if this is merely a component of WEB/TeX or if it is unique enough to classify as its own language.
5. `MetaSyntax` (discovered in early 2023, August) I am trying to figure out of this is just syntax, or an actual classifiable language. MetaFont may get merged in with this.
6. ***No other contested languages at the moment.***

## [New discovery rule 2024 January 13th](#New-discovery-rule-2024-January-13th)

Languages sent to me via image, audio, text, or video are not included, unless I click on a link to a repository with undiscovered languages

This was proposed to close a loophole that would completely overwhelm me (such as someone sending me a sizeable list of languages)

***

## [New discovery rule 2024 January 14th](#New-discovery-rule-2024-January-14th)

As an emergency fix to a flaw I noticed in yesterdays proposal, I am making a second consecutive proposal: Links clicked on by me from now will yield a maximum of 5 languages per domain per day. This way, I can catch myself from going too far.
