# 2022, Wednesday, December 7th

## Hiatus day 7

The project was temporarily completed on 2022, Tuesday, November 29th, and the data for phase 3 (2022) was finalized the next day (2022, Wednesday, November 30th)

Unfortunately, 1 new entry was found right on the day I could have been caught up.

Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !-->

<!--
This is the end of phase 3 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`.
