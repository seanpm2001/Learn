## 2022 Phase 4 day 7 (end of hiatus, finalization)

I finally finalized work for phase 4 today, there wasn't very much of it.

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`.
