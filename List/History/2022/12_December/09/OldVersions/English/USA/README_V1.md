## 2022 Phase 4 day 1

I created the repositories for what had been held off today. A `Learn` repository and a `SNU 2D Programming Tools IDE` repository was created for the Xtend language. Documenting the change in the core `Learn` repository however, was held off.

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!--
This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`.
