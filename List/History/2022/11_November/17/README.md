# 2022 November 17th

## Catchup day 6

The project was partially, temporarily completed on 2022, Friday, November 11th, 13 new entries are now waiting, but today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date. The current phase finished today, new repositories are expected to start being created in a few days (2022, November 21st or later) new entries will be created at a much lower rate (2/day instead of 5/day, so that I can also continue to keep the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository up to date. This is the end of phase 2 of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`.
