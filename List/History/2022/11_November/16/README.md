# 2022 November 16th

## Catchup day 5

The project was partially, temporarily completed on 2022, Friday, November 11th, 12 new entries are now waiting, but today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, but progress has continued to be slow against expectations. Moderate progress was made today. It is still currently estimated to be caught back up on 2022, Saturday, November 20th at the current rate.
