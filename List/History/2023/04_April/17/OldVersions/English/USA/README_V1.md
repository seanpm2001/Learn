## Phase 5 day 117 (frozen)

I did not work with any new languages today, and I didn't come across any new languages today. I did update the `Learn` repository with status updates today, along with some other changes (a documentation center for keywords, a new branch navigation directory, a new graphics directory, and version 130 of the project README.md file, with a new supporters section)

I came across a new language on 2023, April 11th. My calendar is booked for the rest of the month, so it is going to have to wait. I also don't think I can learn Tamil in this time, so I will use machine translation.

The new language is Ezhil, a Tamil language programming language that I discovered via Wikipedia. It is pretty obscure, and seems to have been abandoned. It will still be documented.

**Coming up next:**

1. **Ezhil** (?DATE?)
2. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
