## Phase 5 day 119 (frozen)

I did not work with any new languages today, and I didn't come across any new languages today. I did update the `Learn` repository with 3 major new features (a blog, a supporters page, and a template library) I finished importing Geekster data into the [:octocat: `Learn-HTML`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-HTML/) repository, and was working on updating it further. Unfortunately, I could't find my HTML corpus data, so I couldn't finish.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/)

I came across a new language on 2023, April 11th. My calendar is booked for the rest of the month, so it is going to have to wait. I also don't think I can learn Tamil in this time, so I will use machine translation.

The new language is Ezhil, a Tamil language programming language that I discovered via Wikipedia. It is pretty obscure, and seems to have been abandoned. It will still be documented.

**Coming up next:**

1. **Ezhil** (?DATE?)
2. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
