## Phase 5 day 124 (frozen)

I did not work with any new languages today, and I didn't come across any new languages today. I did update the `Learn` repository with the usual small blog update (for the current file)

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

I came across a new language on 2023, April 11th. My calendar is booked for the rest of the month (and now up to 2023, May 25th) so it is going to have to wait. I also don't think I can learn Tamil in this time, so I will use machine translation. I booked my calendar up to 2023, May 25th, so it is planned for 2023, Friday, May 26th

The new language is Ezhil, a Tamil language programming language that I discovered via Wikipedia. It is pretty obscure, and seems to have been abandoned. It will still be documented.

**Coming up next:**

1. **Ezhil** (2023, Friday, May 26th)
2. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
