## Phase 5 day 104 (unfrozen)

I worked with the Objective-J# and Objective-J++ languages today, but couldn't complete work tonight, as our family dog (Guinea) died shortly before 8:45 pm, and I took the rest of the night off to mourn. I didn't come across any new languages again today.

**Coming up next:**

1. **AGRAN** (2023, Thursday, April 6th)
2. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
