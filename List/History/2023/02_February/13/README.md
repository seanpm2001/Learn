# 2023, Monday, February 13th

## Phase 5 day 54 (frozen)

I didn't work with any new languages or the learn project in general today. I plan on returning on 2023, February 15th to work with SQF and Processing (language) as I forgot to make a set of repositories for processing, and just recently noticed.

On further delay (past 2023, February 15th)

1. **BlooP** (2023, February 16th)
2. **FlooP** (2023, February 16th)
3. **BLISS** (2023, February 17th)
4. **SNOBOL** (2023, February 18th)
5. **Commenter** (2023, February 19th)
6. **RAML** (2023, March 2nd)
7. **Ermine** (2023, March 4th)

I recently discovered the RAML and Ermine languages on 2023, Sunday February 12th. RAML is a language that feels familiar, yet I have never actually heard of it until today. It is likely due to me misspelling YAML as RAML at some point in the past 3 years.

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
