## Phase 5 day 59 (unfrozen)

I worked with the SNOBOL language today. I have 1 more consecutive day of work to do before I have a 10 day break from this project.

**Coming up next:**

1. **Commenter** (2023, February 19th)
2. **RAML** (2023, March 2nd)
3. **Ermine** (2023, March 4th)
4. **Processing** (2023, March 7th)
5. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
