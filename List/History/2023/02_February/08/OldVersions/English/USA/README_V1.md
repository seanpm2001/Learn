# 2023, Wednesday, February 8th

## Phase 5 day 49 (frozen)

I didn't work with any new languages today, as I am prioritizing a new beginning date of 2023, February 10th. On 2023, February 6th, I learned about the SQF programming language when looking for source code examples of BLISS (also newly discovered) I also learned of the FlooP and BlooP languages. Recently, on 2023, February 7th, I have discovered the CUE language.

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
