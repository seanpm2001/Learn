It is unofficially called `the Cairo phase` (since the first language worked with in the phase is the Cairo programming language) and will last until I reach 600 total languages. Previously, there was no structure for what qualified phase 5 to end or start, so a goal was needed. This change was long overdue.** _(worked with Cairo language)_ |

| #️⃣️006 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Wednesday, July 12th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, project language files for Whitespace were written, taking over an hour.

### [Overview](#Overview)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)]</u></b></p></summary>

This repository stayed in maintenance mode for a sixty-ninth consecutive day today. I kept the repository up to date today in the history section only. After finishing last nights entry, I later came across 4 new languages in the night (AMF (Action Message Format), ASN.1, Apache Avro, and ErlangDoc (edoc)) I discovered these languages through reading about Cap'n Proto, and going off towards Binary Data Exchange formats. So far, no new languages were discovered today, as of 4:44 pm PST.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

1. .zone files (discovered on 2023, May 13th) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
2. robots.txt (discovered before 2020) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
3. Text (plain) (discovered before 2011) if included, it may also include special text formats, such as `robots.txt` `.zone` files, `CMakeLists.txt` files, and more
4. [:octocat: `International Scheme`](https://github.com/metaphorm/international-scheme/) (discovered on 2023, June 2nd) currently figuring out if this software library can count as a separate language
5. Turtle (discovered on 2023, June 5th) turtle may just be a syntax, and not a standalone language, but I will need to look further into this before I can confirm.
6. RDF Query Language (discovered on 2023, June 6th) trying to figure out if this is a distinct language.
