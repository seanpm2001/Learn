### [Overview](#Overview)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)]</u></b></p></summary>

I took a break from new languages today, and was not able to properly update the `/Learn/` repository outside of the daily blog. I won't resume with new languages until 2023, July 7th, when I start to work with the Cairo language. I have been rapidly learning new languages, with at least one new language discovered per day for several days in the past week. It is making my queue seem overwhelming.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

1. .zone files (discovered on 2023, May 13th) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
