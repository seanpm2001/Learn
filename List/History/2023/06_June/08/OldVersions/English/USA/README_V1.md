I did not work with any new languages today. Work will resume on 2023, Wednesday, July 21st.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

1. I came across another language on 2023, May 1st (`beef`) my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, June 21st.
2. I came across another language on 2023, May 20th (`harbour`) my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, June 22nd. I would have delayed it by a few days to reduce tension in my workload, but I decided to take the risk. If something goes wrong, I will move it, but for now, it is scheduled for 2023, June 22nd.
3. I came across an obscure language on 2023, May 22nd (`FML/Fuzzy Markup Language`) I didn't mention it until 2023, May 25th, as I overlooked it. Nonetheless, my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until some time in 2023 June or July. I finally picked a start time of 2023, June 23rd, on 2023, May 29th.
4. I came across a new language on 2023, May 24th very late at night (several hours after my work on this repository had been finalized for the day) ([`Tampio`](https://github.com/fergusq/tampio/)) I didn't mention it until 2023, May 25th. Nonetheless, my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until some time in 2023 June or July. I finally picked a start time of 2023, June 26th, on 2023, May 29th.
5. I came across a new language on 2023, June 4th (`Cairo`) after finishing this list for the day. My schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, Friday, July 7th
6. I came across a new language on 2023, June 4th (`Plankalkül`) after finishing this list for the day. My schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, Monday, July 10th. This isn't a notable language for modern programming.
7. I came across a new language on 2023, June 4th (`Whitespace`) after finishing this list for the day. My schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, Tuesday, July 11th.
8. I came across a new language on 2023, June 4th (`Wisp`) after finishing this list for the day. My schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, Thursday, July 13th.
9. I came across a new language on 2023, June 4th (`XBase++`) after finishing this list for the day. My schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, Friday, July 14th
10. No other new languages at the moment.

#### [Contested languages](#Contested-languages)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (contested languages)]</u></b></p></summary>

1. .zone files (discovered on 2023, May 13th) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
2. robots.txt (discovered before 2020) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
3. Text (plain) (discovered before 2011) if included, it may also include special text formats, such as `robots.txt` `.zone` files, `CMakeLists.txt` files, and more
4. [`International Scheme`](https://github.com/metaphorm/international-scheme/) (discovered on 2023, June 2nd) currently figuring out if this software library can count as a separate language
5. Turtle (discovered on 2023, June 5th) turtle may just be a syntax, and not a standalone language, but I will need to look further into this before I can confirm.
6. RDF Query Language (discovered on 2023, June 6th) trying to figure out if this is a distinct language.
7. No other contested languages at the moment.

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !-->
