| #️⃣️001 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Friday, July 7th | 🗒️: **Phase 6 started on 2023, Friday, July 7th. It is unofficially called `the Cairo phase` (since the first language worked with in the phase is the Cairo programming language) and will last until I reach 600 total languages. Previously, there was no structure for what qualified phase 5 to end or start, so a goal was needed. This change was long overdue.** _(worked with Cairo language)_ |

| #️⃣️006 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Wednesday, July 12th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, project language files for Whitespace were written, taking over an hour.

Project language files and other finalizations were not done yesterday, I hope to finish them today.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.
