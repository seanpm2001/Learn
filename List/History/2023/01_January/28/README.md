# 2023, Friday, January 27th

## Phase 5 day 38 (unfrozen)

I worked with the Lobster language today. Initially, I planned for a hiatus today, but I wanted to fit a language into the daily schedule. Here are my plans for the rest of the month for this project (v2):

| Date | Number of languages | Hiatus day |
|---|---|---|
| `2023.01.24` | `0` | `Yes` |
| `2023.01.25` | `2` | `No` |
| `2023.01.26` | `1` | `No` |
| `2023.01.27` | `1` | `No` |
| **2023.01.28 (today)** | **1** | **No** |
| `2023.01.29` | `1` | `No` |
| `2023.01.30` | `2` | `No` |
| `2023.01.31` | `1` | `No` |

This may change again, but I hope to stay consistent with this plan. Notes for February have yet to be started, 1 new language is not included into the January count.

I have come across 2 more languages on 2023, Thursday, January 26th. They may get squeezed into this schedule, or they may be held off until February.

I came across an additional pair of 2 more languages on 2023, Saturday, January 28th. THey have been squeezed into the January 30th timeslot.

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
