It is unofficially called `the Cairo phase` (since the first language worked with in the phase is the Cairo programming language) and will last until I reach 600 total languages. Previously, there was no structure for what qualified phase 5 to end or start, so a goal was needed. This change was long overdue.** _(worked with Cairo language)_ |

I have 2 more days to try and do this.** |
| #️⃣️006 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Wednesday, July 12th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, project language files for Whitespace were written, taking over an hour.

### [Overview](#Overview)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)]</u></b></p></summary>

This repository stayed in maintenance mode for a one-hundred-fifth consecutive day today. The repository was brought back up to date in the history section only today. Todays GitHub fork process was done early, and no new languages were discovered. No languages have been discovered today, as of 04:45 pm PST. Documentation changes are getting a makeover, but have made this file harder to maintain. It is still a major work in progress. For now, it has mostly stalled. <!-- TODO: This line should be updated daily !-->

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

> **Note** _Future plan: Split up dialects and implementations into different sections._

1. `*.zone` files (discovered on 2023, May 13th) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
2. `robots.txt` (discovered before 2020) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
3. `Text (plain)` (discovered before 2011) if included, it may also include special text formats, such as `robots.txt` `.zone` files, `CMakeLists.txt` files, and more
4. [:octocat: `International Scheme`](https://github.com/metaphorm/international-scheme/) (discovered on 2023, June 2nd) currently figuring out if this software library can count as a separate language
5. `Turtle` (discovered on 2023, June 5th) turtle may just be a syntax, and not a standalone language, but I will need to look further into this before I can confirm.
6. `RDF Query Language` (discovered on 2023, June 6th) trying to figure out if this is a distinct language.
7. `MetaFont` (discovered on 2023, July 6th) I am trying to figure out if this is merely a component of WEB/TeX or if it is unique enough to classify as its own language.
8. `MetaSyntax` (discovered in early 2023, August) I am trying to figure out of this is just syntax, or an actual classifiable language. MetaFont may get merged in with this.
9. ***No other contested languages at the moment.***
