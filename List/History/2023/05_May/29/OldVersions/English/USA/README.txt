# 2023, Monday, May 29th

## Phase 5 day 159 (frozen)

### Overview

I did not work with any new languages today, and I didn't come across any new languages either. Work will resume on 2023, Wednesday, July 21st. Hoever, I did schedule some upcoming languages today.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

### New languages

1. I came across another language on 2023, May 1st (`beef`) my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, June 21st.
2. I came across another language on 2023, May 20th (`harbour`) my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until 2023, June 22nd. I would have delayed it by a few days to reduce tension in my workload, but I decided to take the risk. If something goes wrong, I will move it, but for now, it is scheduled for 2023, June 22nd.
3. I came across an obscure language on 2023, May 22nd (`FML/Fuzzy Markup Language`) I didn't mention it until 2023, May 25th, as I overlooked it. Nonetheless, my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until some time in 2023 June or July. I finally picked a start time of 2023, June 23rd, on 2023, May 29th.
4. I came across a new language on 2023, May 24th very late at night (several hours after my work on this repository had been finalized for the day) (`Tampio`) I didn't mention it until 2023, May 25th. Nonetheless, my schedule is so backed up, that I cannot start work with this language until some time in 2023 June or July. I finally picked a start time of 2023, June 26th, on 2023, May 29th.

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
