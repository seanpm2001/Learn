## Phase 5 day 84 (frozen)

I returned to this project today, and worked with the DataWeave language. I was having a good day today until one of my dogs had to be euthanized, which severely threw me off time-wise. It still hurts immensely. RIP Milly.

**Coming up next:**

1. **Gremlin** (2023, March 16th)
2. **Wasp** (2023, March 16th)
3. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
