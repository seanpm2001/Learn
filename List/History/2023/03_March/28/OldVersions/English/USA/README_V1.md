# 2023, Tuesday, March 28th

## Phase 5 day 97 (frozen)

I did not work with any new languages today, as I am taking another break (until 2023, Wednesday, March 29th, tomorrow)

I did not come across any new languages again today. A new language was added to the queue on 2023, Tuesday, March 21st, it has not been released yet, and it has been redacted, until being revealed on 2023, March 28th.

On 2023, Wednesday, March 22nd, I added 6 more languages (the 6 languages I develop that haven't been added to the list yet) they are planned to be worked on from 2023, Sunday, April 2nd to 2023, Tuesday, April 4th.

**Coming up next:**

1. **BlockQL** (2023, Wednesday, March 29th)
2. **DSergeant** (2023, Sunday, April 2nd)
3. **GRANNY** (2023, Sunday, April 2nd)
4. **MCPYECL** (2023, Monday, April 3rd)
5. **Objective-C#** (2023, Monday, April 3rd)
6. **Objective-J#** (2023, Tuesday, April 4th)
7. **Objective-J++** (2023, Tuesday, April 4th)
8. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
