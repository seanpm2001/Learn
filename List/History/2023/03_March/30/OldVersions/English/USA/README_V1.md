# 2023, Thursday, March 30th

## Phase 5 day 99 (frozen)

Today was day 1 of 3 of my break from this project. No new languages were worked with, and I didn't come across any new languages again today. I also didn't prioritize updating the `History` section of the `Learn` repository.

**Coming up next:**

1. **DSergeant** (2023, Sunday, April 2nd)
2. **GRANNY** (2023, Sunday, April 2nd)
3. **MCPYECL** (2023, Monday, April 3rd)
4. **Objective-C#** (2023, Monday, April 3rd)
5. **Objective-J#** (2023, Tuesday, April 4th)
6. **Objective-J++** (2023, Tuesday, April 4th)
7. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
