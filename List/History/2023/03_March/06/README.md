## Phase 5 day 75 (frozen)

I took a 1 day hiatus from the project today, and plan to return tomorrow for 3 consecutive days, before going on a vacation.

**Coming up next:**

1. **Processing** (2023, March 7th)
2. **MGears** (2023, March 8th)
3. **Google Apps Script** (2023, March 8th)
4. **Mojom** (2023, March 9th)
5. **DataWeave** (2023, March 15th)
6. **Gremlin** (unscheduled)
7. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
