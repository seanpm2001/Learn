## Phase 5 day 77 (unfrozen)

I returned to the project to work with the Google Apps Script and MGears languages today, the latter being one I created. I plan to work for 1 more consecutive dayshere, then I will go on a vacation. Wasp was added to the queue today, it was discovered when I was trying to find the source code for the website [`WebStandardsProject, or WaSP`](https://www.webstandards.org/index.html/) as I noted that its search function was broken, as it just led to a GitHub Pages 404 page. I never found the source code, but I found a very obscure, Haskell-based language.

**Coming up next:**

1. **Mojom** (2023, March 9th)
2. **DataWeave** (2023, March 15th)
3. **Gremlin** (2023, March 16th)
4. **Wasp** (2023, March 16th)
5. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
