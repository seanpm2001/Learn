## Phase 5 day 78 (unfrozen)

I worked with the Mojom language today, a very obscure Google language. I also created a logo for it, as it didn't previously have one. I plan on taking a break from this project until 2023, March 15th, as I have a 2 day vacation starting tomorrow, and I additionally have plans for 2023, March 12th to 14th.

**Coming up next:**

1. **DataWeave** (2023, March 15th)
2. **Gremlin** (2023, March 16th)
3. **Wasp** (2023, March 16th)
4. **Other (unknown)** (?DATE?)

<!-- Today wasn't planned to be a development day for new repositories. I am taking a temporary break from it to work on other projects. If I can gather more languages, I might start phase 4 (2022) earlier. <!-- Work is being done to get the [`Learn`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn/) repository back up to date, as I couldn't keep up in the last 3 days of phase 3 of 2022. The current phase finished yesterday (2022, Tuesday, November 29th) new repositories are expected to start being created at an unknown time in 2022 December. !--> 

<!-- This is the end of phase 4 (2022) of the acceleration project for `seanpm2001/Learn`. !-->
