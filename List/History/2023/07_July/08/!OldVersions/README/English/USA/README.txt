| Day # | Frozen? | Phase 6 date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | False | 2023, Friday, July 7th | **Phase 6 started on 2023, Friday, July 7th. It is unofficially called `the Cairo phase` (since the first language worked with in the phase is the Cairo programming language) and will last until I reach 600 total languages. Previously, there was no structure for what qualified phase 5 to end or start, so a goal was needed. This change was long overdue.** (worked with Cairo language) |
| 002 | True | 2023, Saturday, July 8th | **No new languages were worked weith today, a timeline was added, and icons were added for Cairo a day late** |

### [Overview](#Overview)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)]</u></b></p></summary>

I took a break from new languages today, and was not able to properly update the `/Learn/` repository outside of the daily blog. Work resumes in 2 days, and will resume with the Plankalk端l language, which I am currently working on converting the name to ANSI (due to a problem with the umlaut `端` which will show up as `-` in the repository name. I don't want to render it as `Plankalk-l`) and learning the very basics of the language. A timeline for phase 6 was also added today.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

1. .zone files (discovered on 2023, May 13th) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
2. robots.txt (discovered before 2020) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
3. Text (plain) (discovered before 2011) if included, it may also include special text formats, such as `robots.txt` `.zone` files, `CMakeLists.txt` files, and more
4. [:octocat: `International Scheme`](https://github.com/metaphorm/international-scheme/) (discovered on 2023, June 2nd) currently figuring out if this software library can count as a separate language
5. Turtle (discovered on 2023, June 5th) turtle may just be a syntax, and not a standalone language, but I will need to look further into this before I can confirm.
6. RDF Query Language (discovered on 2023, June 6th) trying to figure out if this is a distinct language.
7. MetaFont (discovered on 2023, July 6th) I am trying to figure out if this is merely a component of WEB/TeX or if it is unique enough to classify as its own language.
8. No other contested languages at the moment.
