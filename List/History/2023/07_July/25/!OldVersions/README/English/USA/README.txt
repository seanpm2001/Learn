|---|---|---|---|
| #️⃣️001 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Friday, July 7th | 🗒️: **Phase 6 started on 2023, Friday, July 7th. It is unofficially called `the Cairo phase` (since the first language worked with in the phase is the Cairo programming language) and will last until I reach 600 total languages. Previously, there was no structure for what qualified phase 5 to end or start, so a goal was needed. This change was long overdue.** _(worked with Cairo language)_ |
| #️⃣️002 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Saturday, July 8th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, a timeline was added, and icons were added for Cairo a day late** |
| #️⃣️003 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Sunday, July 9th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, no progress was made on the project, except for ANSI naming decisions for the next day** |
| #️⃣️004 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Monday, July 10th | 🗒️: **Work with the Plankalkül language was done today, but project language files could not be created due to a lack of string or comment support, and an inability to figure out how to do this with just numbers. The dail blog and timeline were also updated.** |
| #️⃣️005 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Tuesday, July 11th | 🗒️: **Work with the Whitespace language was done today, but the language was a difficult one, and I didn't have the time to finish today due to severe procrastination. My plan is to make a file for Whitespace with source code examples for every individual letter and character that I need, and then I can copy and paste it into an extremely long file. I have 2 more days to try and do this.** |
| #️⃣️006 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Wednesday, July 12th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, project language files for Whitespace were written, taking over an hour. It was fun, and I am told to regard it as an activity similar to a video game (leisure activity) rather than actual work, which will now apply to other EsoLangs as well. I contributed 2573 lines to the online collection of Whitespace source code. I also updated the Learn history log and timeline.** |
| #️⃣️007 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Thursday, July 13th | 🗒️: **Work was done with the Wisp language today in full. The history log was updated, and the timeline was also updated to include Emojis** |

| #️⃣️011 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Monday, July 17th | 🗒️: **Work was done with the BennuGD language today. This is the last consecutive work day on this project for now in the field of new languages, this repository will go into maintenance mode for 10 days (until 2023, Friday, July 28th) The history log and timeline were also updated.** |

This repository stayed in maintenance mode again today, as no new languages were worked with. The repository will continue to receive light updates until 2023, Friday, July 28th, until new languages are worked with again, meaning it is staying in maintenance mode for 2 more days. The history log and timeline were updated today. Today was the third day of my 2023 July vacation. I am having some difficulty right now researching the OpenAI Triton language.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.
