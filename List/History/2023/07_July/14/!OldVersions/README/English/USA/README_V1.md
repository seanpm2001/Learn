| #️⃣️ Day # | 🧊️ Frozen? | 📅️ Phase 6 date | 📓️ Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| #️⃣️001 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Friday, July 7th | 🗒️: **Phase 6 started on 2023, Friday, July 7th. It is unofficially called `the Cairo phase` (since the first language worked with in the phase is the Cairo programming language) and will last until I reach 600 total languages. Previously, there was no structure for what qualified phase 5 to end or start, so a goal was needed. This change was long overdue.** _(worked with Cairo language)_ |
| #️⃣️002 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Saturday, July 8th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, a timeline was added, and icons were added for Cairo a day late** |
| #️⃣️003 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Sunday, July 9th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, no progress was made on the project, except for ANSI naming decisions for the next day** |
| #️⃣️004 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Monday, July 10th | 🗒️: **Work with the Plankalkül language was done today, but project language files could not be created due to a lack of string or comment support, and an inability to figure out how to do this with just numbers. The dail blog and timeline were also updated.** |
| #️⃣️005 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Tuesday, July 11th | 🗒️: **Work with the Whitespace language was done today, but the language was a difficult one, and I didn't have the time to finish today due to severe procrastination. My plan is to make a file for Whitespace with source code examples for every individual letter and character that I need, and then I can copy and paste it into an extremely long file. I have 2 more days to try and do this.** |
| #️⃣️006 | ✅️ True ☑️ | 🗓️: 2023, Wednesday, July 12th | 🗒️: **No new languages were worked with today, project language files for Whitespace were written, taking over an hour. It was fun, and I am told to regard it as an activity similar to a video game (leisure activity) rather than actual work, which will now apply to other EsoLangs as well. I contributed 2573 lines to the online collection of Whitespace source code. I also updated the Learn history log and timeline.** |
| #️⃣️007 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Thursday, July 13th | 🗒️: **Work was done with the Wisp language today in full. The history log was updated, and the timeline was also updated to include Emojis** |
| #️⃣️008 | ❌️ False ✖️ | 🗓️: 2023, Friday, July 14th | 🗒️: **Work was done with the XBase++ language today. The history log and timeline were also updated.** |

### [Overview](#Overview)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)]</u></b></p></summary>

I began work with the XBase++ language today. I will continue work tomorrow with the SmPL language, although I am a bit upset with my former self for letting myself schedule 2 days of this project on the weekend, when I needed a break. I will get a 10 day break after 2023, Monday, July 17th.
 
I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

6. RDF Query Language (discovered on 2023, June 6th) trying to figure out if this is a distinct language.
7. MetaFont (discovered on 2023, July 6th) I am trying to figure out if this is merely a component of WEB/TeX or if it is unique enough to classify as its own language.
8. No other contested languages at the moment.
