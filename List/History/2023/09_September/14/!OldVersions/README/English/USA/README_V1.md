### [Overview](#Overview)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (overview)]</u></b></p></summary>

This repository stayed in maintenance mode for a twenty-ninth consecutive day today. The repository was kept up to date today in the history section, but still remains out of date elsewhere. As of 6:53 pm, no new languages have been discovered today.

I have plans to resume work on existing `Learn` repositories, starting with [:octocat: `Learn Vala`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-Vala/) it is currently unknown when this will start.

#### [Contested languages](#Contested-languages)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section (contested languages)]</u></b></p></summary>

1. .zone files (discovered on 2023, May 13th) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
2. robots.txt (discovered before 2020) cannot figure out if it can be considered a language, or a subset of plain text format.
3. Text (plain) (discovered before 2011) if included, it may also include special text formats, such as `robots.txt` `.zone` files, `CMakeLists.txt` files, and more
4. [:octocat: `International Scheme`](https://github.com/metaphorm/international-scheme/) (discovered on 2023, June 2nd) currently figuring out if this software library can count as a separate language
5. Turtle (discovered on 2023, June 5th) turtle may just be a syntax, and not a standalone language, but I will need to look further into this before I can confirm.
6. RDF Query Language (discovered on 2023, June 6th) trying to figure out if this is a distinct language.
7. MetaFont (discovered on 2023, July 6th) I am trying to figure out if this is merely a component of WEB/TeX or if it is unique enough to classify as its own language.
8. MetaSyntax (discovered in early 2023, August) I am trying to figure out of this is just syntax, or an actual classifiable language. MetaFont may get merged in with this.
9. A-0 system (discovered on 2023, August 12th) I am trying to figure out if this compiler can be classified as a language.
10. Laning and Zierler system (discovered on 2023, August 12th) I am trying to figure out if this compiler can be classified as a language.
11. No other contested languages at the moment.
