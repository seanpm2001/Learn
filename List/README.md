# Learning lists

<details open><summary><b lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse the lead section</b></summary>

This is a collection of list data for the Seanpm2001 learn project. List data is in the URLL file format. It is essentially a URL list file. It is a plain text format. You can learn more about it here:

- [`URLL Specification on GitHub`](https://github.com/URLL-Specification/) [**Disclaimer:** This project is also run by [`@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)]

On an unrelated note, if you can, please help me spread the adoption of the URLL list file by using it in your project. It is best used for storing 2 or more links in a list, although it can be used for storing single links. Its main benefit over the typical `.*url` or `*.lnk` files is that it is plain text, cross-platform, and can store multiple links, and doesn't require a strict syntax, so it is easy to learn. It is not officially recognized by GitHub yet, but I hope for it to be in the future. Visit the project for more info.

The lists here use URLL version 2. Included changes from version 1 include a Shebang, and comments

```elm
-- This is what a comment looks
```

```elm
--URLL-version=2;
-- This is what a shebang looks like
```

Elm syntax highlighting is being used in place of URLL syntax highlighting, as the language isn't notable enough to be recognized by GitHub yet.
