[Geekster](https://www.geekster.in/) is an Indian programming blog and programming education website in the field of full-stack programming, web development, and more.

Geekster is the first major supporter of this repository, and the first major supporter for any of my projects outside of family. Geekster sent me an email in 2023 April regarding the [:octocat:` Learn-HTML`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-HTML/) repository, and asked to display 2 links.

I first added the links to the main `Learn` repository on 2023 April 17th, then on the target repository on 2023, April 19th. I am open to further collaboration.

Geekster has given me permission to promote them on my projects. I am not being paid to do this. I do not have a Geekster account at the moment either. I have reviewed the content of the site and find it to be in good standing.
