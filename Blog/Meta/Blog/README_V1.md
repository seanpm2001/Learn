### [The new blog](/Blog/Meta/Blog/)

I added a blog to the `Learn` repository today. It will hold quick announcements for improvements to the group of Learn repositories. This is the 3rd blog entry. The blog will only announce new improvements. For documentation, you still refer to the [Docs](/Docs/) Announcements will be brief.
