# Learn programming

<details open><summary><b lang="en">Click/tap here to expand/collapse the title/lead section</b></summary>

Current progress `422`/`436` (as of 2022, Tuesday, November 1st at 11:59 pm PST, also as of 2022, Wednesday, October 26th at 9:40 pm PST)

<!-- Note: KiCad Layout and KiCad Schematic are listed as 2 separate entries on this list, but not on the learn repositories themselves
Update 2022.09.13: KiCad Layout and KiCad schematic have been separated, and also a 3rd KiCad entry was added. 1 entry was removed from the current progress due to this
!-->

**Ratio:** `96.78%` complete, `03.22%` incomplete.

_I occassionally learn of new languages, so this number will keep going up._

This list covers the creation of the language repositories.

(It might be cheating, but I am including 3 of my computing languages on this list (DroppedText, Matrix, and URLL) if I am to be documenting all languages, I should at least document my own)

## How I discover languages

I discover languages either by reading about them on an external site (commonly Wikipedia) or browsing source code on GitHub. Sometimes, I discover languages via Gedit, but I don't always add it to my list.

### Why not use the GitHub language list

I do use the GitHub language list sometimes, but I try not to use it as an official source of new languages, as so I don't overwhelm myself. GitHub lists several hundred languages in its advanced search, I hope to come across as many of these as I can on my own.
