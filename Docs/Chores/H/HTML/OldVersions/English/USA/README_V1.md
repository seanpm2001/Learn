# Chore: HTML

A personal task for [:octocat: `@seanpm2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## Find corpus

**Requested:** `2023, Wednesday, April 19th at 5:42 pm PST)`

I need to find the data for my knowledge of HTML at some point. I was updating the [:octocat: `Learn-HTML`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-HTML/) on 2023, Wednesday, April 19th, and I couldn't find my corpus of data regarding HTML. I have it somewhere. It may be difficult to implement into the repository, for now, I just need to find the log. It would take too long to manually recreate it.

## Implement data

- Prerequisites: 
- [ ] [Find corpus](#Find-corpus)
- [ ] Make time
 
I need to implement the data into the [:octocat: `Learn-HTML`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Learn-HTML/) repository to make the repository more complete. It is a vital Learn repository, and has priority over hundreds of `Learn` repositories.
