## Methods

[IGNORE.md file](https://github.com/IGNORE-file) - Used to create folders in Git, since no other way to do this is obvious/existant to me

[Snapshot Version Control System](https://github.com/Snapshot-Version-Control-System/) - Old method that is still in use, used prior to Git, still used out of habit

[Project language files](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Project-language-file/) - An extra feature used to define the top language used in the project, and its purpose, or to list every language in use.

Other methods not yet listed

## Goals

In regards to programming languages, my goal is to learn the basics of EVERY programming and markup language, or at the minimum, know its name. This is a lifelong goal.
